Notes from meeting on September 16th, 2019

- insights and zenhub tab on github are where the instructors are looking to see contributions
- every single commit should be linked to a story
   - one story can be used for multiple commits
   - even minor changes/bug fixes need to be linked to a user story
- commit messages need to be condense but detailed enough to give a picture of what happens
- user story titles should be a brief explaination of whats inside the story
   - some stories may require dependencies (ie. UI based things) so we can express what overall concept they belong to
- there should be user stories that reflect the dummy iu for sprint one explaining what we would want out of the ui
   - this story as well as every other story should include an acceptance test in the comments which verifies
     that the story is complete and should be completed during the same sprint as the story it pertains to
- any code that is to be looked at/graded at each sprint must be push to master otherwise it won't be considered
   - this might lead to getting points off of a story if it is due but not pushed to master
